This file contains instructions for building/packaging on each supported platform.

All Platforms
-------------
Set save_location to "home" in ../save_location.cfg

Copy the contents of cheese-engine/docs to ../docs

Update the information in ../version.h

Windows
-------
Open the Code::Blocks project, select the desired build target, and press build

Linux
-----
Open the Code::Blocks project, select the desired build target, and press build

OS X
----
Open the Code::Blocks project, select the desired build target, and press build
	
Update CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString in *.app/Contents/Info.plist

Place the binary in *.app/Contents/MacOS/ and rename it to 'game'

Copy the data files into *.app/Contents/Resources/

Save the icon as a .png, use Img2icns to convert it to a .icns, and move that into *.app/Contents/Resources/
Name the icon file icon.icns

Create a disk image from the .app directory using Disk Utility

Android
-------
Place the .keystore in android/

Update the version information in android/AndroidManifest.xml

Choose one of the APP_ABI lines in android/jni/Application.mk and make sure the other one is commented out
'all' builds for all supported architectures (Note that currently 'mips' is disabled)
'armeabi-v7a' builds for ARMv7 (useful for testing)

Choose either release or debug options in android/jni/Application.mk and make sure the other set of options
is commented out

Copy data files into android/assets/

Run android/create-asset-lists.bat to create asset lists within the assets subdirectories

Run android/jni/create-symlinks.bat to create symlinks to the necessary library directories
Don't forget to remove the symlinks when done building (ExactFile doesn't like them, and they make me nervous)

Run create-source-file-list.bat in android/jni/src/
Copy the results from android/jni/src/source_file_list to android/jni/src/Android.mk
Don't forget to remove the "/" after the final source file

Run android/build.bat to build the C/C++ source code for the libraries and the game

Run android/ant-release-build.bat to create the .apk
