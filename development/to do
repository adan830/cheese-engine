LMMS sounds are scratchy
It seems to only affect the FreeBoy plugin's sounds, and only on Linux
For now, I've kept the original sound data files generated in Windows LMMS and set the build system to not
rebuild sound files

In Desktop mode, fullscreen, 1280x720, the small font looks terrible
This seems to be true in other modes as well
